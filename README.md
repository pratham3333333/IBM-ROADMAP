## 📌 4. How a Chatbot Works

**Process:**

1. **Understand**: Extracts intent & entities using NLP
2. **Reason**: Chooses best action using rules/ML
3. **Learn**: Improves from feedback
4. **Interact**: Generates a human-like response

**Example:**
User: *"Book a flight to Delhi for tomorrow"*

* Intent = Book Flight
* Entities = Destination=Delhi, Date=Tomorrow

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input] --> B[NLP: Extract Intent & Entities]
    B --> C[Reasoning Engine: Rules/ML]
    C --> D[Learning: Feedback & Training Data]
    D --> E[Response Generation]
    E --> F[Bot Interacts with User]
```

---

## 📌 5. Intents, Entities, and Dialogs

* **Intent:** The goal of the user (*BookFlight, CheckWeather*)
* **Entity:** Specific details in the request (*City=Delhi, Date=Tomorrow*)
* **Dialog:** Flow of conversation between bot and user

**Example:**
*"Book a flight to Mumbai on Monday"* →
Intent = BookFlight | Entity = City=Mumbai, Date=Monday | Dialog = Bot asks: *“What time do you prefer?”*

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Intent: What user wants]
    B --> C[Entities: Details like Location, Date]
    C --> D[Dialog: Bot asks follow-up if needed]
    D --> E[Final Response/Action]
```

---

## 📌 6. Appropriate Uses for Chatbots

**Good use cases:**

* Customer support

---

### 11. What is the Difference Between Interpretability & Explainability?

* **Interpretability** → Technical view (how model works inside).
* **Explainability** → User view (simple reason).
  **Example**:
* Doctor sees model math = interpretability.
* Patient hears “high sugar level” = explainability.

---

### 12. What is Transparency in AI?

**Meaning**: Being open about how AI works.
**Example**: Social media telling how ads are shown.
